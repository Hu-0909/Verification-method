Verification method based on matter.js physics engine„ÄÅ

This is a demo based on the verification method of the matter.js physics engine.

Due to the fact that this project has obtained software copyright, only some instances are displayed here without the authorization of other co authors, and a more complete system cannot be displayed here.

The three demos are:  
1.Choose the slowest sliding object  
2.Choose the object with the highest elastic stiffness coefficient  
3.Control the big ball to hit the building block

Verification is one-time. If you want to try again, please refresh the page.

Give it a try, I hope it can bring you some joy and inspiration!!!
